# Agentic AI Experiments

This repository is dedicated to deepening my understanding of agentic AI frameworks, tools, and techniques, with a focus on developing practical skills and solutions that can be directly applied to real-world environments and challenges.

## Focus Areas

I am exploring and prototyping with:
- **Autogen**: For building multi-agent workflows and automation.
- **LangGraph**: For constructing language model-powered graphs and agentic flows.
- **OpenAI SDK**: For interfacing with OpenAI's APIs and building LLM-powered applications.
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: For orchestrating complex, modular agentic systems.

## Goals
- Understand the capabilities and limitations of modern agentic AI frameworks.
- Build hands-on projects to deepen my knowledge of autonomous agents and orchestration.
- Experiment with different architectures and integration patterns.
- Document learnings and best practices as I go.
